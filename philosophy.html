          <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
            <p>I believe that a teacher should adopt a learner-centered approach and act as a mentor to the students. He or she not only should be a good teacher but also should treat each student as a person to build their confidence and ensure their success in academic, professional, and personal lives. </p>
            <p>I am driven by this philosophy whenever I communicate with my students in or outside of class. I always do my best to go the extra mile for my students to provide them innovative, effective, and personalized support to improve their performance.</p>
            <p>From my experience as a student and an instructor, I know that students produce their best when they receive personalized guidance. This is particularly important in a skill-based class where students expect to receive adequate technological support. </p>
            <p>Moreover, they give their best efforts when they can relate the coursework with their future career. Therefore, I provide them real-world examples while talking about the concepts. I make sure that the students understand the importance of the given tasks and set their learning goals accordingly. Apart from that, I work to create a comfortable environment in the classroom so that students do not hesitate to ask questions, engage with others, express opinions, or present new ideas.</p>
            <p>My teaching method reflects my philosophy of personalized care. In small classrooms, I try to know each student individually and address their needs and concerns with empathy. I go beyond my teaching responsibilities to genuinely help my students, which often include conducting one-on-one sessions outside of my office hours and providing additional support to underachieving students. </p>
            <p>Student evaluations reflect success of my teaching style. One student commented in his/her course evaluation: <i>“Dr. Isa offered real world advice for dealing with situations that could be potentially difficult for video journalists. He was very professional and understanding and receptive to everyone's questions and ideas.”</i> Another student wrote: <i>“I really enjoyed this class and am forever grateful for it! The professor was very helpful and I would definitely take another course with him.”</i></p>
